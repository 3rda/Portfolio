So, this is my project about data visualization. All the data, i got from http://fbref.com. I'll explain in short what each file stands for 
1. AdvancedGK.csv = Advanced Goalkeeper stats (PSxG, PSxG +/-, etc) 
2. DefensiveAction.csv = Stats related to defense (TackleWin, TackleVsDribble, etc)
3. GCA.csv = Goal Creation Action (SCA (Shoot Creation Action), GCA (Goal Creation Action), etc)
4. Gk.csv = Basic Goalkeeper stats (Goal Allowed, Saves, Shot on target Againts, etc)
5. Msc.csv = Miscellaneous stats (Headers Won, Header Lost, etc)
6. Passing.csv = Stats related to passing (Short Pass Completion, Medium Pass Completion, Long Pass Completion, etc)
7. Position_Players.csv = Processed Stats that i use for visualization. 
8. Shooting.csv = Stats related to shooting (Shot on Target, xG (expected Goals), npxG(non-penalty expected Goals), etc)
9. Top 5 League Stats '21-'22.ipynb = Jupyter notebook that i used to process all of the data above.

Below are some visualization that i made using jupyter:
